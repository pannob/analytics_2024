# Philip's Projects 

## 1) Machine Learning: Random Forest and XGBoost Classification

File Name: student_dataset_random_forest.ipynb

Classification task using a kaggle dataset - predicting pass/fail for **student assignments** based on selected features.
Full Machine Learning process - preprocessing, exploratory analysis and feature engineering.
Initially used random forest with attempted tuning - XGB added on to attempt improved prediction.

- Python based

  -  data transformation: **numpy/pandas**
  -  visualisation: **seaborn**
  -  classification task: **sklearn/xgboost**

## 2) Machine Learning: Multiple Linear Regression

File Name: minutes_played_vs_activities_2024.ipynb

Regression analysis exploring the relationship between in **game (MMO)** activities and minutes played for players.
Preprocessing and fields engineered prior to ask in SQL, some pseudo data was generated - 
more a task to explore my thought process behind a regression analysis relevant to my previous work. 

- Python based
    - data transformation: **numpy/pandas**
    - visualisation: **seaborn/plotly**
    - regression analysis: **sklearn**

## 2) Data Visualisation: Interactive Dashboard with Web Integration

File Name: markdownnotebook.Rmd

Visualisation project breaking down a Kaggle dataset focused on data science job roles. Wanted to explore highcharts
visualisation as I'd seen praise for its interactive nature and easy cross device scaling - a great tool 
for sharing data with customers; something I'm keen to explore.

- R based
    - data visualisation: **highcharter**, **flexdashboard**
    - data wrangling: **tidyverse**, **dplyr**
