# Philip's Projects 

## 1) Machine Learning: Multiple Linear Regression

File Name: minutes_played_vs_activities_2024.ipynb

Regression analysis exploring the relationship between in game (MMO) activities and minutes played for players.
Data already preprocessed and fields engineered, some pseudo data was generated - more a task to explore my thought
process behind a regression analysis relevant to my previous work. 

- Python based
    - data transformation: **numpy/pandas**
    - visualisation: **seaborn/plotly**
    - regression analysis: **sklearn**

## 2) Machine Learning: Random Forest and XGBoost Classification

File Name: student_dataset_random_forest.ipynb

Classification task using a kaggle dataset - predicting pass/fail based on selected features.
Full Machine Learning process - preprocessing, exploratory analysis and feature engineering.
Initially used random forest with attempted tuning - XGB added on to attempt improved prediction.
