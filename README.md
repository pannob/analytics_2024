## 1) Machine Learning: Multiple Linear Regression

File Name: minutes_played_vs_activities_2024.ipynb

Regression analysis exploring the relationship between in game (MMO) activities and minutes played for players.
Data already preprocessed, some pseudo data was generated - more a task to explore my thought process behind a regression analysis relevant to my previous work. 

- Python based
    - data transformation: **numpy/pandas**
    - visualisation: **seaborn/plotly**
    - regression analysis: **sklearn**
